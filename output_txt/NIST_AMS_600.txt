Executive Summary 
This report provides a statistical review of the U.S. manufacturing industry. There are 
three aspects of U.S. manufacturing that are considered: (1) how the U.S. industry 
compares to other countries, (2) the trends in the domestic industry, and (3) the industry 
trends compared to those in other countries. The U.S. remains a major manufacturing 
nation; however, other countries are rising rapidly.  
 
Although U.S. manufacturing performs well in many respects, there are opportunities for 
advancing competitiveness. This will require strategic placement of resources to ensure 
that U.S. investments have the highest return possible. 
 
Competitiveness – Manufacturing Industry Size: In 2021, there was $14.5 trillion of 
value added (i.e., GDP) in global manufacturing in constant 2015 dollars. The U.S. 
accounted for $2.4 trillion (16.3 %) in manufacturing valued added while China 
accounted for $4.5 trillion (30.9 %). Direct and indirect (i.e., purchases from other 
industries) manufacturing accounts for 24.1 % of GDP. Among the ten largest 
manufacturing countries, the U.S. is the 4th largest manufacturing value added per capita 
(see Figure 2.5) and out of all countries the most recent U.S. rank is 14th, as illustrated in 
Figure 2.6. In 2020, China outranked the U.S. in all of 6 major subsectors (see Figure 2.8) 
 
 
Competitiveness – Manufacturing Growth: Compound real (i.e., controlling for 
inflation) annual growth in the U.S. between 1996 and 2021 (i.e., 25-year growth) was 
2.1 %, which places the U.S. below the 50th percentile. The compound annual growth for 
the U.S. between 2016 and 2021 (i.e., 5-year growth) was 2.2 %. This puts the U.S. just 
above the 50th percentile, above Canada and Germany among others. 
 
Competitiveness – Productivity: Labor productivity for manufacturing decreased by 
1.0 % between the second quarter of 2022 and the second quarter of 2023, as illustrated 
in Figure 4.9. The five-year compound annual growth is -0.6 %. For U.S. manufacturing, 
total factor productivity increased 3.6 % from 2020 to 2021 and has a 5-year compound 
annual growth rate of 0.7 %, as illustrated in Figure 4.10. Productivity in the U.S. is 
relatively high compared to other countries. As illustrated in Figure 4.11, the U.S. is 
ranked ninth in output per hour among 142 countries using data from the Conference 
Board. In recent years, productivity growth has been negative or has come to a plateau in 
many countries and the U.S. seems to be following this pattern of slow growth. There are 
competing explanations for why productivity has slowed, such as an aging population, 
inequality, or other factors. A number of the explanations equate to low levels of capital 
investment. It is also important to note that productivity is difficult to measure and even 
more difficult to compare across countries. Moreover, the evidence does not seem to 
support any particular explanation over another as to why productivity appears to have 
stalled. 
 
Competitiveness – Economic Environment: There is no agreed upon measure for 
research, innovation, and other factors for doing business, but there are a number of 
NIST AMS 600-13 
November 2023 
vi 
common measures that are used. The ranking of the U.S. in these measures has mixed 
results, ranking high in some and lower in others. For instance, the U.S. ranks 4th in 
patent applications per million people but ranks 17th in researchers per capita and 24th in 
journal article publications per capita. The IMD World Competitiveness Index, which 
measures competitiveness for conducting business, ranked the U.S. 9th in competitiveness 
for conducting business and the World Economic Forum, which assesses the 
competitiveness in determining productivity, ranked the U.S. 2nd.  Note that neither of 
these are specific to manufacturing, though. A third index specific to manufacturing, the 
Deloitte Global Manufacturing Index, ranks China 1st and the U.S. 2nd. The Competitive 
Industrial Performance Index, which measures capacity to produce and export 
manufactured goods; technological deepening and upgrading; and world impact, ranked 
the U.S. as 5th.  
 
Domestic Specifics – Types of Goods Produced: The largest manufacturing subsector in 
the U.S. is computer and electronic products followed by chemical manufacturing and 
food, beverage, and tobacco products, as seen in Figure 2.12. Discrete technology 
products accounted for 37 % of U.S. manufacturing. 
 
Domestic Specifics – Economic Disruptions: From the pre-recession peak in the 4th 
quarter of 2007 to the 1st quarter of 2009 manufacturing declined 17 percentage points. 
Manufacturing didn’t return to its pre-recession level until 2017. During the recent 
pandemic, manufacturing value added declined 17 percentage points between the third 
quarter of 2019 and second quarter of 2020, but returned to similar levels within a year. 
As of July 2023, employment was still 8.9 % below its 2005 level. As a result of the 
pandemic, between January 2005 and January 2010, manufacturing employment declined 
by 19.6 %, as seen in Figure 4.1.  
 
Domestic Specifics – Manufacturing Supply Chain Costs:  High-cost supply chain 
industries/activities, which might pose as opportunities for advancing competitiveness, 
include various forms of energy production and/or transmission, various forms of 
transportation, the management of companies and enterprises among other items listed in 
Table 3.6.  
 
Domestic Specifics – Manufacturing Safety, Compensation, and Profits: As illustrated 
in Figure 4.5, employee compensation in manufacturing, which includes benefits, has had 
a five-year compound annual growth of -1.0 %, but remains 6.3 % above total private 
industry compensation. In May of 2018 the average hourly wages for the total private 
sector exceeded that of manufacturing, which was not the case before that time. 
Compensation in manufacturing, which includes benefits, still exceeds that of the total 
private industry; however, the difference has narrowed significantly. In terms of safety in 
manufacturing, fatalities, injuries, and the injury rate have generally trended downward 
since 2002, as seen in Figure 4.2. However, there has been a slight uptick. Between 2020 
and 2021, fatal occupational injuries increased 12.6 % and nonfatal injuries/illnesses 
increased 3.2 %.

For those that invest in manufacturing, corporate profits have had a five-year compound 
annual growth of 10.4 %, as illustrated Figure 4.7, and nonfarm proprietors’ income for 
manufacturing has had a five-year compound annual growth rate of -8.4 %, as illustrated 
in Figure 4.8.

Introduction 
 
Background  
Public entities have a significant role in the U.S. innovation process.1 The federal 
government has had a substantial impact in developing, supporting, and nurturing 
numerous innovations and industries, including the Internet, telecommunications, 
aerospace, semiconductors, computers, pharmaceuticals, and nuclear power among 
others, many of which may not have come to fruition without public support.2 Although 
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Small Business Innovation 
Research Program (SBIR), and Advanced Technology Program (ATP) have received 
attention in the scholarly community, there is generally limited awareness of the 
government’s role in U.S. innovation. The vastness and diversity of U.S. federal research 
and development programs along with their changing nature make them difficult to 
categorize and evaluate,3 but their impact is often significant. For instance, the origins of 
Google are rooted in a public grant through the National Science Foundation.4, 5 One 
objective of public innovation is to enhance economic security and improve our quality 
of life6, which is achieved in part by advancing efficiency in which resources are 
consumed or impacted by production. This includes decreasing inputs, which amount to 
costs, and negative externalities (e.g., environmental impacts) while increasing output, 
(i.e., the products produced), and the function of the product (e.g., the usefulness or 
quality of the product), as seen in Figure 1.1. In pursuit of this goal, the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (NIST) has expended resources on a number of projects, 
such as support for the development of the International Standard for the Exchange of 
Product Model Data (STEP),7 which reduces the need for duplicative efforts such as re-
entering design data.

Purpose of this Report 
The purpose of this report is to characterize U.S. innovation and industrial 
competitiveness in manufacturing, as it relates to the objectives illustrated in Figure 1.1. 
It includes tracking domestic manufacturing activity and its supply chain in order to 
develop a quantitative depiction of U.S. manufacturing in the context of the domestic 
economy and global industry. There are five aspects that encapsulate the information 
discussed in this report: 
 
• Growth and Size: The size of the U.S. manufacturing industry and its growth rate 
as compared to other countries reveals the relative competitiveness of the 
industry. 
o Metrics: Value added, value added per capita, assets, and compound 
annual growth 
 
• Productivity: It is necessary to use resources efficiently to have a competitive 
manufacturing industry. Productivity is a major driver of the growth and size of 
the industry. 
o Metrics: Labor productivity index, total factor productivity index, output 
per hour 
 
• Economic Environment: A number of factors, including research, policies, and 
societal trends, can affect the productivity and size of the industry.  
NIST AMS 600-13 
November 2023 
3 
o Metrics: Research and development expenditures as a percent of GDP, 
journal articles per capita, researchers per capita, competitiveness indices, 
inflation, patents 
 
• Stakeholder Impact: Owners, employees, and other stakeholders invest their 
resources into manufacturing with the purpose of receiving some benefit. The 
costs and return that they receive can drive industry productivity and growth. 
However, data is limited on this topic area. 
o Metrics: Number of employees, compensation, safety incidents, profits, 
exports, hours worked 
 
• Areas for Advancement: It is important to identify areas of investment that have 
the potential to have a high return, which can facilitate productivity and growth in 
manufacturing. 
o Metrics: High-cost supply chain components, country comparison indices 
 
Currently, this annual report discusses items related to inputs for production and outputs 
from production. It does not discuss negative externalities, the inputs that are used in the 
function of a product (e.g., gasoline for an automobile), or the function of the product; 
however, these items might be included in future reports.  
 
Manufacturing metrics can be categorized by stakeholder, scale, and metric type (see  
Figure 1.2). Stakeholders include the individuals that have an interest in manufacturing. 
All the metrics in this report relate directly or indirectly to all or a selection of 
stakeholders. The benefits for some stakeholders are costs for other stakeholders. For

instance, the price of a product is a cost to the consumer but represents compensation and 
profit for the producers. The scale indicates whether the metric is nominal (e.g., the total 
U.S. manufacturing revenue) or is adjusted to a notionally common scale (e.g., revenue 
per capita). The metric type distinguishes whether the metric measures manufacturing 
activities directly (e.g., total employment) or measures those things that affect 
manufacturing (e.g., research and development).  These metrics are then compared over 
time and/or between industries to provide context to U.S. manufacturing activities. 
 
Scope and Approach 
There are numerous aspects one could examine in manufacturing. This report discusses a 
subset of stakeholders and focuses on U.S. manufacturing. Among the many datasets 
available, it utilizes those that are prominent and are consistent with economic standards. 
These criteria are further discussed below. 
 
Stakeholders: This report focuses on the employees and the owners/investors, as the data 
available facilitates examining these entities. Future work may move toward examining 
other stakeholders in manufacturing, such as the consumers and general public. 
 
Geographic Scope: Many change agents are concerned with a certain group of people or 
organizations. Since NIST is concerned with "U.S. innovation and competitiveness," this 
report focuses on activities within national borders. In a world of globalization, this effort 
is challenging, as some of the parts and materials being used in U.S.-based manufacturing 
activities are imported. The imported values are a relatively small percentage of total 
activity, but they are important in regard to a firm’s production. NIST, however, 
promotes U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness; therefore, consideration of 
these imported goods and services are outside of the scope of this report. 
 
Standard Data Categorization: Domestic data in the U.S. tends to be organized using 
NAICS codes, which are the standard used by federal statistical agencies classifying 
business establishments in the United States. NAICS was jointly developed by the U.S. 
Economic Classification Policy Committee, Statistics Canada, and Mexico’s Instituto 
Nacional de Estadística y Geografía, and was adopted in 1997. NAICS has several major 
categories each with subcategories. Historic data and some organizations continue to use 
the predecessor of NAICS, which is the Standard Industrial Classification system (SIC). 
NAICS codes are categorized at varying levels of detail. The broadest level of detail is 
the two-digit NAICS code, which has 20 categories. More detailed data is reported as the 
number of digits increase; thus, three-digit NAICS provide more detail than the two-digit 
and the four-digit provides more detail than the three-digit. The maximum is six digits. 
Sometimes a two, three, four, or five-digit code is followed by zeros, which do not 
represent categories. They are null or place holders. For example, the code 336000 
represents NAICS 336. International data tends to be in the International Standard 
Industrial Classification (ISIC) version 3.1, a revised United Nations system for 
classifying economic data. Manufacturing is broken into 23 major categories (ISIC 15 
through 37), with additional subcategorization. This data categorization works similar to 
NAICS in that additional digits represent additional detail.

Data Sources: Thomas (2012) explores a number of data sources for examining U.S. 
manufacturing activity.8 This report selects from sources that are the most prominent and 
reveal the most information about the U.S. manufacturing industry. These data include 
the United Nations Statistics Division’s National Accounts Main Aggregates Database 
and the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of Manufactures, among others. Because 
the data sources are scattered across several resources, there are differences in what 
yearly data is available for a particular category or topic.  In each case, the most-up-to-
date and available information is provided for the relevant category. 
 
Data Limitations: Like all collections of information, the data on manufacturing has 
limitations. In general, there are 3 aspects to economic data of this type: 1) breadth of the 
data, 2) depth of the data, and 3) the timeliness of the data. The breadth of the data refers 
to the span of items covered, such as the number of countries and years. The depth of the 
data refers to the number of detailed breakouts, such as value added, expenditures, and 
industries. In general, breadth and depth are such that when the number of items in each 
are multiplied together it equals the number of observations in the dataset for a particular 
time period. For instance, if you have value added data on 5 industries for 20 countries 
for a single year, then you would have 100 observations (i.e., 5 x 20 = 100). The 
timeliness of the data refers to how recently the data was released. For instance, is the 
data 1 year old or 5 years old at release. In general, data can perform well in 2 of these 3 
criteria, but it is less common to perform well on all 3 due to feasibility of data collection 
(see Figure 1.3). Moreover, in this report there is data that is very recent (timeliness) and 
spans numerous subsectors (depth), but it only represents the United States. On the other 
hand, there is data that spans multiple countries (breadth) and subsectors of 
manufacturing (depth); however, this data is from several years ago. Fortunately, industry 
level trends change slowly; thus, the data may not be from the most recent years, but it is 
still representative.

Value Added 
 
Value added is the primary metric used to measure economic activity. It is defined as the 
increase in the value of output at a given stage of production; that is, it is the value of 
output minus the cost of inputs from other establishments.9 The primary elements that 
remain after subtracting inputs is taxes, compensation to employees, and gross operating 
surplus; thus, the sum of these also equal value added. Gross operating surplus is used to 
calculate profit, which is gross operating surplus less the depreciation of capital such as 
buildings and machinery. The sum of all value added for a country is that nation’s Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP).  
 
International Comparison  
There are a number of sources of international estimates of value added for 
manufacturing. The United Nations Statistics Division National Accounts Main 
Aggregates Database has a wide-ranging dataset that covers a large number of countries 
over a significant period of time. In 2021, there was $14.5 trillion of value added (i.e., 
GDP) in global manufacturing in constant 2015 dollars, which is 17.5 % of the value 
added by all industries ($82.7 trillion), according to the United Nations Statistics 
Division. Since 1970, manufacturing ranged between 13.7 % and 17.5 % of global GDP. 
The top 10 manufacturing countries accounted for $10.4 trillion or 71.7 % of global 
manufacturing value added: China (30.9 %), United States (16.3 %), Japan (6.1 %), 
Germany (4.9 %), South Korea (3.2 %), India (3.0 %), United Kingdom (2.2 %), Italy 
(1.9 %), France (1.7 %), and Indonesia (1.5 %).10 
 
As seen in Figure 2.1, U.S. compound real (i.e., controlling for inflation) annual growth 
between 1996 and 2021 was 2.1 %, which places the U.S. below the 50th percentile. This 
growth exceeded that of Germany, France, Canada, Japan, and Australia; however, it is 
slower than that for the world (3.8 %) and that of many emerging economies. It is 
important to note that emerging economies can employ idle or underutilized resources 
and adopt technologies that are already proven in other nations to achieve high growth 
rates. Developed countries are already utilizing resources and are employing advanced 
technologies; thus, comparing U.S. growth to the high growth rates in China or India has 
limited meaning. As seen in Figure 2.2, the compound annual growth for the U.S. 
between 2016 and 2021 was 2.2 %. This puts the U.S. just above the 50th percentile 
above Canada and Germany among others but still below the world growth of 2.9 %. 
 
As seen in  Figure 2.3, among the 10 largest manufacturing nations, U.S. manufacturing 
value added, as measured in constant 2015 dollars, is the second largest. In current

dollars, the U.S. produced $2.4 trillion in manufacturing valued added while China 
produced $4.5 trillion. As illustrated in Figure 2.4, U.S. manufacturing value added was 
11.5 % of national GDP in 2021. In comparison, Germany’s manufacturing industry was 
22.2 %, China was 28.4 %, and Japan was 20.6 % with the world average being 17.5 %. 
Although the U.S. is below average, this can be somewhat deceiving, as 2021 U.S. GDP 
per capita ($61 103) is significantly higher than both Japan ($34 603) and Germany 
($38 217) along with most other countries, which makes the denominator 
disproportionally larger when calculating the proportion of the economy that 
manufacturing represents. Thus, a more meaningful measure might be manufacturing 
GDP (i.e., value added) per capita. Among the ten largest manufacturing countries, the 
U.S. has the 4th largest manufacturing value added per capita, as seen in Figure 2.5. Out 
of all countries the U.S. ranks 14th, as seen in Figure 2.6. Since 1970, the U.S. ranking 
has ranged between 11th and 16th. It is important to note that there are varying means for 
adjusting data that can change the rankings slightly. The UNSD data uses market 
exchange rates while others might use purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates. 
PPP is the rate that a currency in one country would have to be converted to purchase the 
same goods and services in another country. The drawback of PPP is that it is difficult to 
measure and methodological questions have been raised about some surveys that collect

data for these calculations.11 Market based rates tend to be relevant for internationally 
traded goods;12 therefore, this report often utilizes these rates. 
 
In terms of subsectors of manufacturing, the U.S. ranks 1st in 7 industries out of 16 total, 
as seen in Figure 2.7 while China was the largest for the other industries. Since this data 
covers multiple industries for multiple years (i.e., it has breadth and depth), it is a few 
years old (i.e., 2015). Nonetheless, it likely provides a close representation, as national 
activity generally moves slowly. 
 
A more recent estimate of manufacturing value added by subsector and country is 
provided in Figure 2.8, which provides estimates for 2020; however, the subsectors are 
broader than those in Figure 2.7. Data for some countries was not available, however, 76 
countries have data for all six subsectors. These countries represent 91.3 % of global 
manufacturing. The data in Figure 2.8 shows the U.S. being the second largest country in 
terms of valued added for every subsector except textiles and clothing, where it is the 
fourth largest. China is the largest for all subsectors.

Note: These values were estimated using the total manufacturing valued added from the United Nations Statistics Division multiplied 
by the percent of manufacturing value added that each sector represents from the World Bank. 
Note: Data for all six categories were available for 76 countries; thus, the estimates do not reflect total global production. The 
countries with all six categories available represent 91.3 % of global manufacturing.

Domestic Details 
There are two primary methods for adjusting value added for inflation. The first is using 
chained dollars, which uses a changing selection of goods to adjust for inflation. The 
second uses an unchanging selection of goods to adjust for inflation. 13 There has been 
some dispute about the accuracy of each for some goods. This report presents value 
added in chained dollars. Previous reports included both; however, the differences are 
often minor.

Figure 2.9 shows the cumulative change in manufacturing, durable goods, and 
nondurable goods manufacturing from 2005 forward. From the pre-recession peak in the 
4th quarter of 2007 to the 1st quarter of 2009 manufacturing declined 17 percentage 
points. Manufacturing didn’t return to its pre-recession level until 2017. During the recent 
pandemic, manufacturing value added declined 17 percentage points between the third 
quarter of 2019 and second quarter of 2020, but returned to similar levels within a year.  
 
Manufacturing value added in the U.S. in 2022 was $2.3 trillion in chained 2012 dollars 
or 11.4 % of GDP.14 Using chained dollars from the BEA shows that manufacturing 
increased by 0.2 % between 2021 and 2022. Figure 2.10 and Figure 2.11 provide more 
detailed data on durable and nondurable goods within the manufacturing industry. As 
seen in Figure 2.10, long term growth in durable goods is largely driven by computer and 
electronic products, which should be viewed with some caution, as there has been some 
dispute regarding the price adjustments for this sector, which affects the measured 
growth. Recall that, as of 2015, the U.S. was also the largest producer of computer and 
electronic products. As seen in Figure 2.11, in 2022 only two of eight non-durable sectors 
were above their 2008 value. The largest manufacturing subsector in the U.S. is computer 
and electronic products followed by chemical manufacturing; food, beverage, and 
tobacco products; and motor vehicles, trailers, and parts, as seen in Figure 2.12. Note that 
this is based on chained dollars. Adjustments using other methods or the nominal value 
can have slightly different results.

In addition to examining manufacturing value added, it is useful to examine the capital stock 
in manufacturing, as it reflects the investment in machinery, buildings, and intellectual 
property in the industry (see Figure 2.13, Figure 2.14, Figure 2.15, and Figure 2.16). 
Discrete technology manufacturing (i.e., computer manufacturing, transportation equipment 
manufacturing, machinery manufacturing, and electronics manufacturing) accounts for 30 % 
of all manufacturing equipment and 33 % of structures. The 5-year compound annual growth 
in computer and electronic manufacturing equipment is negative; however, structures is 
growing at a rate of 2.4 %. Recall that in 2015, the U.S. was the largest producer of these 
goods and, as of 2022, it is the largest subsector of U.S. manufacturing.

US Manufacturing Supply Chain 
There are many suppliers of goods and services that have a stake in manufacturing; these 
include resellers, providers of transportation and warehousing, raw material suppliers, 
suppliers of intermediate goods, and suppliers of professional services. Using data from the 
Annual Survey of Manufactures,15  Table 3.1 presents and Figure 3.1 maps the purchases 
that the manufacturing industry made for production, which is disaggregated into five

categories: suppliers of services, computer hardware, software, and other costs (blue); 
refuse removal (gold); machinery, structures, and compensation (orange); repair of the 
machinery and structures (red); and suppliers of materials (green). These items all feed 
into the design and production of manufactured goods which are inventoried and/or 
shipped (gray). The depreciation of capital and net income is also included in Figure 3.1, 
which affects the market value of shipments. In addition to the stakeholders, there are 
also public vested interests, the end users, and financial service providers to be 
considered. 
 
Direct and Indirect Manufacturing: As previously mentioned, to achieve economy-wide 
efficiency improvements, researchers have suggested that “the supply chain must become 
the focus of policy management, in contrast to the traditional emphasis on single 
technologies/industries.” 16 As seen in Table 3.2, there is an estimated $1939 billion in 
manufacturing value added with an additional $2339 billion in indirect value added from 
other industries for manufacturing, as calculated using input-output analysis.17 Direct and 
indirect manufacturing accounts for 24.1 % of total GDP.  
 
In 2021, the U.S. imported approximately 20.4 % of its intermediate goods, as seen in  
Table 3.3. As a proportion of output and imports (i.e., a proportion of the total inputs), 
intermediate imports represented 12.4 %. As can be seen in Table 3.3, these proportions 
have not changed dramatically in recent years. As seen in Table 3.4, Canada is the 
primary source of imported supply chain items for the U.S. with China being second. 
 
Many of the direct costs are caused by losses due to waste or defects. Unfortunately, 
there is limited data and information on these losses. The research that does exist is often 
case studies within various industries and countries, which provide only limited insight to

U.S. national trends. Tabikh estimates from survey data in Sweden that the percent of 
planned production time that is downtime amounts to 13.3 %.18 According to NIST’s 
Manufacturing Cost Guide, downtime amounts to 8.3 % of planned production time and 
amounts to $245 billion for discrete manufacturing (i.e., NAICS 321-339 excluding 
NAICS 324 and 325).19 In addition to downtime, defects result in additional losses. The 
Manufacturing Cost Guide estimates that defects amount to between $32.0 billion and 
$58.6 billion for discrete manufacturing (i.e., NAICS 321-339 excluding NAICS 324 and 
325), depending on the method used for estimation.20  
 
The USGS estimates that 15 % of steel mill products end up as scrap in the 
manufacturing process.21 Other sources cite that at least 25 % of liquid steel and 40 % of 
liquid aluminum does not make it into a finished product due primarily to metal quality

(25 % of steel loss and 40 % of aluminum loss), the shape produced22 (10 % to 15 % of 
loss), and defects in the manufacturing processes (5 % of loss).23 Material losses mean 
there is the possibility of producing the same goods using less material, which could have 
rippling effects up and down the supply chain. There would be reductions in the burden 
of transportation, material handling, machinery, inventory costs, and energy use along 
with many other activities associated with handling and altering materials.  
 
Another source of losses can be found in cybercrime where criminals can disrupt 
production and/or steal intellectual property. The Manufacturing Cost Guide estimates 
that manufacturers lost between $8.9 billion and $38.6 billion due to cybercrime.  
 
Manufacturing costs also accumulate in assets such as buildings, machinery, and 
inventory. In addition to the estimates provided in Figure 2.13, Figure 2.14, Figure 2.15, 
and Figure 2.16, data on assets is published periodically in the Economic Census. As seen 
in Table 3.5, total depreciable assets amount to $3.4 trillion with $2.7 trillion being 
machinery and equipment.  
 
 
22 The steel and aluminum industry often produce standard shapes rather than customized shapes tailored to specific products. This 
results in needing to cut away some portion of material, which ends up as scrap.

A frequently invoked axiom suggests that roughly 80 % of a problem is due to 20 % of 
the cause, a phenomenon referred to as the Pareto principle. 24 That is, a small portion of 
the cause accounts for a large portion of the problem. Joseph Juran proposed that the 
Pareto principle could be applied to an organization’s operations.25 For instance, 80 % of 
defects would be the result of 20 % of the causes. Identifying that small portion of the 
cause (i.e., the 20 %) can facilitate making large efficiency improvements in operations. 
Manufacturing industry NAICS codes are categories of production activities. A larger 
industry (i.e., one in the top 20 %) suggests that there is more of a particular type of 
activity and/or the activities are more costly; thus, an increase in productivity in a larger 
industry would either reduce a costly activity or reduce an activity that occurs at high 
frequency. The result is a greater impact than might otherwise be achieved. Additionally, 
statistical evidence suggests that a dollar of research and development in a large cost 
supply chain entity has a higher return on investment than a small cost one.26 Table 3.6 
provides a list of the top 20 % of domestic supply chain industries for U.S. manufacturing 
by value added. Various forms of energy production and/or transmission appear in the top 
20 %. Various forms of transportation are also present along with the management of 
companies and enterprises. Table 3.7 provides compensation by occupation and 
management occupations is the 2nd largest.

Employment, Compensation, Profits, and Productivity 
 
The Annual Survey of Manufactures estimates that there were 11.2 million employees in the 
manufacturing industry in 2021, which is the most recent data available (see Table 4.1). The 
Current Population Survey estimates that there were 15.2 million manufacturing employees in 
2022 and the Current Employment Statistics estimates 12.8 million employees in 2022, the most 
recent data available (see Table 4.2 and Table 4.3). According to data in Table 4.2, 
manufacturing accounted for 9.6 % of total employment. Each of these estimates has its own 
method for how the data was acquired and its own definition of employment. The Current 
Population Survey considers an employed person to be any individual who did any work for pay 
or profit during the survey reference week or were absent from their job because they were ill, on 
vacation, or taking leave for some other reason. It also includes individuals who completed at 
least 15 hours of unpaid work in a family-owned enterprise operated by someone in their 
household. In contrast, the Current Employment Statistics specifically exclude proprietors, self-
employed, and unpaid family or volunteer workers. Therefore, the estimates from the Current 
Employment Statistics are lower than the Current Population Survey estimates. Additionally, the 
Current Employment Statistics include temporary and intermittent employees. The Annual 
Survey of Manufactures considers an employee to include all

It also excludes proprietors along with partners of unincorporated businesses.  
 
Between January 2005 and January 2010, manufacturing employment declined by 19.6 %, as 
seen in Figure 4.1. As of July 2023, employment was still 8.9 % below its 2005 level. In times of 
financial difficulty, large purchases are often delayed or determined to be unnecessary. Thus, as 
would be expected, during the late 2000’s recession durable goods declined more than 
nondurable goods. The other major decline in manufacturing employment was during the 
pandemic. Between January 2019 and April of 2020, manufacturing employment declined 10 
percentage points to be 19.9 % below its 2005 level. By September 2021, manufacturing 
employment had risen to 12.8 % below its 2005 level. However, at that time there were a 
substantial number of job openings in manufacturing as seen in Figure 4.1.

The employees that work in manufacturing offer their time and, in some cases, risk their personal 
safety in return for compensation. In terms of safety, the number of fatal injuries increased 
12.6 % between 2020 and 2021 (see Table 4.4). Nonfatal injuries increased as did the injury rate 
(see Table 4.5). The incident rate for nonfatal injuries in manufacturing remains higher than that 
for all private industry. As illustrated in Figure 4.2, fatalities, injuries, and the injury rate have a 
five-year compound growth rate of -3.8 %, -3.1 %, and -1.7 % respectively.

During the late 2000s recession, the average number of hours worked per week declined, as seen 
in Figure 4.3. Unlike employment, however, the number of hours worked per week returned to 
its pre-recession levels or slightly higher. Average wages increased significantly during the late 
2000’s recession and 2020 decline of GDP, as can be seen in Figure 4.4. This is likely because 
low wage earners are disproportionately impacted by employment reductions, which suggests 
that high wage earners not only receive more pay, but also have more job security. Average 
hours also dropped during the pandemic 
and has largely returned to pre-recession levels. Like the late 2000’s recession, during the 
pandemic wages increased while hours and employment decreased.

The compound annual growth rate in real dollars for private sector wages was 0.6 % between 
July 2018 and July 2023 and compensation was -0.1 % for manufacturing. As illustrated in 
Figure 4.5, employee compensation in manufacturing, which includes benefits, has had a five-
year compound annual growth of -1.0 %, but remains 6.3 % above total private industry 
compensation. In May of 2018 the average hourly wages for the total private sector exceeded 
that of manufacturing, which was not the case before that time. Hourly compensation in 
manufacturing, which includes benefits, still exceeds that of the total private industry; however, 
the difference has narrowed significantly. In the first quarter of 2007, hourly compensation in 
manufacturing was 17.2 % higher than the private sector. By the first quarter of 2023, this 
difference narrowed to 6.3 %. As illustrated in Figure 4.6, the prices received by producers for 
all manufacturing between July 2020 and July 2022 has increased 33.4 % while in the fifteen 
years prior to that (i.e., June 2005 to June 2020) it only increased 27.1 % total. For those that 
invest in manufacturing, corporate profits have had a five-year compound annual growth of 
10.4 %, as illustrated Figure 4.7, and nonfarm proprietors’ income for manufacturing has had a 
five-year compound annual growth rate of -8.4 %, as illustrated in Figure 4.8.

An important aspect of manufacturing is the efficiency and productivity with which resources are 
used. The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides an index of labor productivity and total factor 
productivity. Labor productivity for manufacturing decreased by 1.0 % between  the second 
quarter of 2022 and the second quarter of  2023, as illustrated in Figure 4.9. The five-year 
compound annual growth is -0.6 %. The Bureau of Labor Statistics total factor productivity 
measures “the efficiency at which combined inputs are used to produce output of goods and 
services” (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2023g). For U.S. manufacturing, total factor productivity 
increased 3.6 % from 2020 to 2021 and has a 5-year compound annual growth rate of 0.7 %, as 
illustrated in Figure 4.10. Productivity in the U.S. is relatively high compared to other countries. 
As illustrated in Figure 4.11, the U.S. is ranked ninth in output per hour among 142 countries 
using data from the Conference Board.27

Research, Innovation, and Factors for Doing Business 
 
Manufacturing goods involves not only physical production, but also design and innovation. 
Measuring and comparing innovation between countries is problematic, however, as there is no 
standard metric for measuring this activity. Four measures are often discussed regarding 
innovation: number of patent applications, research and development expenditures, number of 
researchers, and number of published journal articles. As seen in Figure 5.1, the U.S. ranked 4th 
in 2020 in resident patent applications per million people, which puts it above the 95th percentile 
among 138 countries. Using patent applications as a metric can be problematic though, as not all 
innovations are patented and some patents might not be considered innovation. The U.S. ranked 
5th in research and development expenditures as a percent of GDP in 2020, which puts it above 
the 90th percentile (see Figure 5.2) among 84 nations. As seen in Figure 5.3, U.S. enterprise 
research and development expenditures in manufacturing increased 1.8 % between 2018 and 
2019 and has a 5-year compound annual growth rate of 2.9 % (not shown). In terms of 
researchers per million people, the U.S. ranked 17th in 2019, putting it just above the 80th 
percentile (see Figure 5.4). In journal articles per million people it ranked 24th in 2020, and 
China had more articles than the U.S. (see Figure 5.5).28 Exports are also frequently seen as a 
measure of competitiveness. The U.S. was the second largest exporter in 2022, as seen in Figure 
5.6.

In addition to some of the previously mentioned metrics, a number of indices have been 
developed to assess national competitiveness. The IMD World Competitiveness Index provides 
insight into the U.S. innovation landscape. Figure 5.7 provides the U.S. ranking for 20 measures 
of competitiveness. This provides some indicators to identify opportunities for improvement in 
U.S. economic activity. In 2023, the U.S. ranked low in prices, public finance, societal 
framework, and international trade among other things. Overall, the U.S. ranked 9th in 
competitiveness for conducting business.29  
 
The 2016 Deloitte Global Manufacturing Competitiveness Index uses a survey of CEOs to rank 
countries based on their perception. The U.S. was ranked 2nd out 40 nations with China being 
ranked 1st. High-cost labor, high corporate tax rates, and increasing investments outside of the 
U.S. were identified as challenges to the U.S. industry. Manufacturers indicated that companies 
were building high-tech factories in the U.S. due to rising labor costs in China, shipping costs, 
and low-cost shale gas.30 According to

the Deloitte Global Manufacturing Competitiveness Index, advantages to U.S. manufacturers 
included its technological prowess and size, productivity, and research support. China was 
ranked 1st with advantages in raw material supply, advanced electronics, and increased research 
and development spending. China has challenges in innovation, slowing economic growth, 
productivity, and regulatory inefficiency.  
 
The World Economic Forum’s 2019 Global Competitiveness Report uses 12 items to assess the 
competitiveness of 141 economies, which includes the set of “institutions, policies and factors 
that determine a country’s level of productivity.” The U.S. was ranked 2nd overall with various 
rankings in the 12 “pillars” that underly the ranking, as illustrated in Figure 5.8. Within the 12 
“pillars,” there were lower rankings in health, macroeconomic stability, and 
information/communication technology adoption.31 The index uses a set of 90 factors to produce 
the 12 items in Figure 5.8. A selection of those that are relevant to standards, technology, and 
information dissemination are presented in  Table 5.1. Those that have poorer rankings might be 
opportunities for improvement.

The Competitive Industrial Performance Index, published by the United Nations Industrial 
Development Organization, ranks countries based on 3 dimensions: 1) capacity to produce and 
export manufactured goods; 2) technological deepening and upgrading; and 3) world impact.32 
The U.S. ranked 5th overall, as seen in Table 5.2.  
 
The Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs makes inquiries on U.S. entrepreneurs concerning the 
negative impacts of eight items: 
 
• Access to financial capital 
• Cost of financial capital 
• Finding qualified labor 
• Taxes 
• Slow business or lost sales 
• Late or nonpayment from customers

As seen in Figure 5.9, there are five items where more than a third of the firms indicated negative 
impacts, including taxes, slow business or lost sales, unpredictability of business conditions, 
finding qualified labor, and government regulations. 33  
 
Countries are sometimes compared to or alluded to as brands. According to a survey on country 
reputation of products published by Statista (see Figure 5.10), the U.S. ranks 10th among 49 total 
countries. Another ranking from Ipsos (see Figure 5.11), the U.S. ranks 8th. The high ranking of 
the U.S. supports the idea that manufacturers in the U.S. tend to compete based on differentiation 
rather than cost competition.

Discussion 
 
This report provides an overview of the U.S. manufacturing industry. There are 3 aspects of U.S. 
manufacturing that are considered: (1) how the U.S. industry compares to other countries, (2) the 
trends in the domestic industry, and (3) the industry trends compared to those in other countries. 
The U.S. remains a major manufacturing nation; however, other countries are rising rapidly. 
Manufacturing in the U.S. was significantly impacted by the 2000’s recession and the 2020 
economy.  
 
The U.S. accounts for 16.3 % of global manufacturing, according to the United Nations Statistics 
Division National Accounts Main Aggregates Database, making it the second largest. Compound 
real (i.e., controlling for inflation) annual growth in the U.S. between 1996 and 2021 was 2.1 %, 
which places the U.S. below the 50th percentile. The compound annual growth for the U.S. 
between 2016 and 2021 was 2.2 %. This puts the U.S. just above the 50th percentile but above 
Canada and Germany among others. In terms of subsectors of manufacturing, the U.S. ranks 1st 
in 7 industries out of 16 total while China was the largest for the other industries, as reported in 
OECD data. 
 
In 2022, there was an estimated $2.3 trillion in manufacturing value added in chained 2012 
dollars. Using 2012 input-output data adjusted to 2019 dollars, there is an estimated $4278 
billion, including direct and indirect value added, associated with U.S. manufacturing. In 2019, 
the U.S. imported approximately 20.4 % of its intermediate goods, according to BEA data. 
Discrete technology products account for 41 % of manufacturing value added, according to BEA 
data.  
 
From the pre-recession peak in the 4th quarter of 2007 to the 1st quarter of 2009 manufacturing 
declined 17 percentage points. Manufacturing didn’t return to its pre-recession level until 2017. 
During the recent pandemic, manufacturing value added declined 17 percentage points between 
the third quarter of 2019 and second quarter of 2020, but returned to similar levels within a year. 
Between January 2005 and January 2010, manufacturing employment declined by 19.6 %. As of 
July 2023, employment was still 8.9 % below its 2005 level. Between January 2019 and April of 
2020, manufacturing employment declined 10 percentage points to be 19.9 % below its 2005 
level. By September 2021, manufacturing employment had risen to 12.8 % below its 2005 level.

Appendix A. U.S. Semiconductor Manufacturing 
U.S. semiconductor manufacturing value added was $30.4 billion in 2020 and was 10.6 % larger 
in 2020 than it was in 2008, as illustrated in Figure A 1. The industry value added has had a 5-
year compound annual growth rate of 4.2 %. The U.S. has a significant presence in the 
semiconductor manufacturing industry with an estimated 12 % of the global production capacity 
(see Table A 1). As shown in both Table A 1 and Figure A 1, while U.S. semiconductor 
employment has been relatively flat, manufacturing value added has generally grown; however, 
global growth has been faster, as seen in Table A 1. The result is that the U.S. share of the 
industry went from 37 % in 1990 to 12 % in 2020. 
 
As seen in Table A 2, the U.S. has 43 % of the 10 nm to 22 nm process technology market. 
Generally, the lower the number, the greater the performance and the more technologically 
advanced the technology because it represents the space for features on a chip.34 The U.S. has 
little to no capacity for the most advanced technology, which is at the 10 nm or less process 
technology. U.S. owned firms, which own facilities around the world, have a commanding 
position in terms of the design of semiconductors, as seen in Table A 3. Additionally, U.S. firms 
held significant proportions of national markets, including 49.9 % of the Chinese market, and

48.6 % of the Asia Pacific market (see Table A 4). As illustrated in Figure A 2, U.S. productivity 
has grown significantly with a 3.1 % 5-year compound annual growth in total factor productivity 
and 2.9 % for labor productivity. Meanwhile, wages grew slightly between 2008 and 2015; 
however, they generally declined thereafter.

Appendix B. Additive Manufacturing 
Table B.1 provides an approximation of the shipments and value added of the goods produced 
using additive manufacturing in the United States. For this report, this is referred to as the 
additive manufacturing industry. There are other associated activities such as the production of 
the additive manufacturing machinery and materials. These are costs/inputs of the additive 
manufacturing industry. The approximated shipments of goods produced using additive 
manufacturing in the U.S. is $2.8 billion with value added being $1.4 billion. These represent a 
small proportion of the manufacturing industry; however, it should not be concluded that this 
technology is not important or impactful, as it is often an input in the production of other goods. 
For instance, in 2022 utilities were only 1.4 % of GDP, but where would the economy be without 
electricity. Nuts and bolts are a small proportion of the value of a car, but how would be 
assemble an automobile without them. Additive manufacturing facilitates rapid prototyping to 
produce products in a shorter period of time, weight/material reduction, and lower cost 
production for small batches and customized products, including parts for products that are no 
longer produced. Moreover, the size of the industry does not represent the economic impact of 
the technology.
