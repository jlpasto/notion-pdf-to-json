It is, indeed, never an easy task to stick with the theme \n(exhibit A: the recent Met Gala 2024's** \"The Garden of Time\" and sustainability).\nDespite this, some brands did manage to keep their compass pointed towards the \ntheme \"Materia Natura\", and in the grander scheme, true North of non-\ngreenwashing, natural and low-impact materials. \nIn this Biodesign 2024 Report, we diveinto those who married materia with natura, \nspotlighting the rebels reshaping our material world.\n\nMilan Design Week 2024\n“Materia Natura  (Matter Nature) The theme of Fuorisalone 2024” by  Fuori Salone.it*\n“The Met Gala Was A Missed Opportunity For Sustainability”, Elle **\nThe artwork by EX.

While they promise a potential greener goodbye at life’s end, don’t \nbe fooled: production can still be a dirty affair, depending on the type of \npolymer used.\n\n\n\nMonomaterial Plastic - is it \nbetter is it worse?\nVivibarefoot x Balena monomaterial \nfootwear venture: they've engineered \na 3D-printed shoe entirely from \ncompostable monomaterials. \n\nUnlike traditional footwear, which \ncombines multiple materials and \nadhesives, these organic-looking \nshoes are tailor-made from scans of \nyour feet, ensuring a perfect fit that's \nnot only stylish but also fully \nbiodegradable.\n(Photo courtesy of Vivibarefoot)\n1/14\n3/21\nBiodesign Report 2024\nPhoto by Yosafat Herdian\nMonomaterial Plastic - is it \nbetter is it worse?\nMoon Landing\" project by Moon Rabbit Adaptive Lab (Photo: Moon Rabbit Adaptive Lab)\nThis year, Milan saw the work of Moon Rabbit \nAdaptive Lab. Their “Moon Landing” project \ntook Vivibarefoot’s model to new heights, \nshowcasing the prowess of Fused \nDeposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing in \nfootwear. \n\nBy refining their MoonRunner model and \nintegrating Zellerfeld Shoe Company Inc. \ndesign guidelines, the team delivered a \nproduct that's not only custom-fit but also \ntechnologically advanced with distinct \ntextures and optimised printing processes.\n4/22\n1/14\n3/21\nPhoto by Yosafat Herdian\nWood - back into the spotlight\nWood is making a strong comeback, not in a nostalgic \nway, but potentially a great player in the realm of \"Materia \nNatura\". Designers we saw in Milan are gravitating \ntowards types like low-impact, native wood; or \nreclaimed wood, which tells a story of past lives; and \nbamboo - even though, technically speaking, bamboo is \na woody perennial grass in the grass family Poaceae.\n As natural as wood can sound, designers need to be \naware that sourcing and certification can shadow linger, \nquestioning the true footprint of our forested friends.\n\n\n\nTamart Design's \"PTamart Design - 2 stools made from solid oak placed together to create a table \n(Photo: Tamart Design)\nBiodesign Report 2024\nAt Milan Design Week 2024, Tamart Design's \n\"Powered by Love\" exhibition subtly embraced \nnatural materials in their wooden furniture, eschewing \nthe loud sustainability banners for a more \nunderstated, but genuine approach. The showcase \nblended historical designs with modern flair, and was \nindeed a treat to the eyes and the touch.\n5/22\n1/14\n3/21\nWood - back into the spotlight\nBiodesign Report 2024\n4/14\nRAIKU strides into the packaging game with a \nwooden armour that promises the earth. Their \nwrap turns a cubic meter of wood into 20 cubic \nmeters of shock-absorbing fluff.* \n\nThough it might be an easy win against \ntraditional plastic bubble wrap, the wood \nsourcing saga continues - how we can keep the \nsourcing truly sustainable, and what the end-of-\nlife story with this material looks like.\n“From Wood to Wrap: RAIKU Redefines Protection”, \nTocco.earth*\n6/22\nRaiku packaging (Photo courtesy of RAIKU)\nRaiku packaging (Photo courtesy of RAIKU)\nHemp is having a moment, becoming more \nand more present in the design industry. Exhibit \nA would be Mosca Partners’s grand hemp-\ncement brick installations at Milan Design \nWeek 2024. This ancient material requires \nminimal water and pesticides, and sequesters \nCO2 efficiently. \n\nHowever, as hemp scales up in mainstream \nmarkets, the full life cycle impact, especially in \ndiverse climates and soils, still awaits a deeper \ndig.\nHemp - growing in popularity\nHemp-based leather.

If we talk numers, mycelium market \nboasts a projected Compound Annual Growth Rate \n(CAGR) of 27.48% to 2032. Indeed, mycelium offers a \ncleaner blueprint by repurposing agricultural waste. \nBut don't get too giddy — while it's renewable and \nbiodegradable, the real challenge lies in scalability \nand durability in everyday use.\n\n\n\n\n\"Mycelium Market set to \ngrow by 27.5% CAGR \nthrough 2032.\"\nOne notable application of mycelium is MuSkin, the \nsuede-soft invention of Pangaia Grado Zero. Crafted \nentirely from a parasitic fungus, each piece is \nhandcrafted with all its rustic charm.\nMycelium - the coolest kid in the block\n MuSkin, the suede-soft invention of Pangaia Grado Zero \n( Photo courtesy of MuSkin)\nBiodesign Report 2024\n9/22\nMycelium - the coolest kid in the block\nHedelComposite by Kineco Bio (Photo: Kineco Bio)\nBiodesign Report 2024\nAt Milan Design Week 2024, we \nsaw the work of Kineco Bio, who \nis sprouting new design \npossibilities with \nHedelComposite, their mycelium \nDIY kit that grows into anything \nfrom eco-friendly packaging to \nhome decor in just a week. \n\nBut while it's a fun fungi party, the \nquestion remains on the finish of \nproducts which can vary, so it \nmight not be a go-to for \neverything just yet.\nAnother application is in \nshock-absorbing packaging. \nBy collaborating with farmers \nto reuse crop residues that \nwould otherwise burn, \ncontributing to air pollution in \nIndia, Mushloop creates \nalternative to synthetic, \nsingle-use cosmetic \npackaging.\n10/22\n (Photos courtesy of Mushloop)\n11/22\nBiodesign Report 2024\nNew tech and fabrication techniques\nNew tech and fabrication techniques are expected to transform \nthe way we create, and pushing the boundaries of cleaner, less-\nwaste design. From advanced 3D printing materials to novel uses \nof waste, let's dissect the cutting-edge methods and get to the \ncomplex reality beneath the hypes.\nThe artwork by EX. (Andrea Cassi and Michele Versaci) and Giorgio \nFerrero (creative director of MYBOSSWAS) for Fuorisalone 2024. \nThe birth of 3D printing made quite a bang, \nunlocking unprecedented creative freedom, \nand enabling designers to craft complex \ngeometries with ease. \n\nEver since, when the first wave of hypes \nsubsided, the focus now is on finding materials \nthat align with the goals of circular and even \nregenerative design. Readers can agree with \nus that - after all, printing more plastics is not \nthe end, nor the means.\n\n\nBiodesign Report 2024\nNew, Cleaner Materials for 3D Printing\n“Kind Colour & Growth Simulation with 3D Printing”, Tocco.earth*\n“Kind Colour & Growth Simulation with 3D Printing”, \nTocco.earth*\nWe have covered the work of designer \nNik Lee before. He leverages \nadvanced 3D printing technology to \ncreate aesthetically eye-pleasing \nobjects, using biodegradable organic \nwaste* for 3D printing, emphasising \nboth creativity and eco-friendliness.\n12/22\n 3D printing with home compostable and locally \nsourced materials by Nik Lee \n(Photo by @facunruiz)\n 3D printed vase by Nik Lee \n(Photo courtesy of Nick Lee)\n 3D printed vase by Nik Lee \n(Photo courtesy of Nick Lee)\n1/14\n3/21\nPhoto by Yosafat Herdian\nBiodesign Report 2024\nNew, Cleaner Materials for 3D Printing\n“Art meets tech: Philipp Aduatz's 3D sculptures”, Tocco.earth**\nLeatherock© by Hors Studio (Photo by Hors Studio)\n13/22\nFollowing the week in Milan, we are impressed by the work of \nHors Studio's interior pieces. These are printed in \nLeatherock©, a new material made from leather scraps and \na natural binder for large-scale 3D printing. This material \npromises to replace traditional concrete, yet indeed, more \ntests and trials will need to be done to guarantee a \nsuccessful scale-up.\nLess on the material itself, and more on the craftmanship \nside, we met Philipp Aduatz’s work again during Milan Design \nWeek. His pieces combine traditional craftsmanship with 3D \nprinting and CNC milling,** producing visually captivating \nfurniture pieces with great precision.\nGradient Fauteuil by Philipp Aduatz \n14/22\nWhen it comes to chemical composition of materials, \nfirst things we think of might be waste-based recipes \nand bio-based polymers, which recently have taken \nmore stage in our minds. The design world is, indeed, \nseeing a trend towards these more “eco-friendly” \nmaterials, arguably initially sparked by pioneers like \nStella McCartney (her work in 2017: recycled nylon \nEconyl and Mylo, a leather alternative made from \nmycelium).\n\nSince then, more brands are observed to jump on this \nbandwagon, pushing boundaries and greenwashing \nalike. While these developments are promising, it's \nessential to critically assess whether they truly deliver on \ntheir sustainability promises or just offer a glossy green \nveneer.\n\nBiodesign Report 2024\nDevelopments in materials’ chemical \ncomposition\n1/14\n3/21\nPhoto by Yosafat Herdian\nBiodesign Report 2024\nDevelopments in materials’ chemical \ncomposition\n1/14\nOne of the great examples of things-done-right that we \nsaw in Milan is the Bolete collection.* This collection \nfeatures an upholstered chair and multipurpose tables \nmade from Bio-thermopolymer material. This material is \nsaid to be 100% natural origin, non-fossil, compostable, \nand biodegradable. \n\nThis might be the start of a not-so-new trend: designers \nare stepping beyond their traditional roles, beyond soly \ndeveloping products, they now look to improve and \nrearrange materials at a deeper level. The goal is indeed \ntwo fold: to enhance performance while eliminating \nhazardous substances.\n1/22\n1/22\n1/14\n3/21\nPhoto by Yosafat Herdian\nBiodesign Report 2024\nCNC and Laser Cutting for Wood \nUsage Optimisation\nCNC and laser cutting technologies promise to \nenable precise cuts and minimal waste in woodwork. \nAs mentioned in the previous part of the report, \nwood is stepping back into the spotlight in the \n\"Materia Natura\" world.\n\nOne collection that caught our eyes was “Fragment” \nby Studio Sospeso, which upcycles olive wood and \nceramics to create unique handles for furniture. This \nwork breathes new life into pieces whose existence \nwe often forget about (and all the while, an essential \npart of our daily use of furniture). The handles are \nelegant and smooth at the touch, contrasting with its \nindustrial look at first glance.\nDifferent designs of \"Fragment\" furniture handles (Photo by Studio Sospeso)\n16/22\n1/14\n3/21\nBiodesign Report 2024\nPottery Casting Optimisation\nTraditional pottery casting is often considered \na wasteful practice, especially in the \npreparation and disposal of molds. \nOptimisation, in this case, and in an ideal \nsituation, involves using precise, computer-\naided techniques to reduce material waste, \nrecycle excess, and minimise energy usage.\nSome examples can be 3D printing and \nadvanced mold technologies, which allow for \nsmall-scale, high-quality production. \n\nIn Milan, we saw and loved the work of Luis \nGimeno with his luminaires, using 3D printing \ntech and sand, creating very lovely, \naesthetically pleasing pieces of lighting that \ndelight.\nLamp \"Sun\" in the \"Dune\" collection by Luis Gimeno (Photo by Luis Gimeno)\nLamp \"Sun\" in the \"Dune\" collection by Luis Gimeno (Photo by Luis Gimeno)\n17/22\n1/14\n3/21\nBiodesign Report 2024\nComposites and Clusters\nLamp \"Sun\" in the \"Dune\" collection by Luis Gimeno (Photo by Luis Gimeno)\nHere’s an unpopular opinion: composites made \nfrom recycled and bio-based materials should be \ndiscussed more often. They should even be the \nnext big hype, which we will cover more in the \nfuture.\n\nOne great exhibit we saw in Milan was the work of \nArper. Composed of 29 layers of paper bonded \nwith natural resin, Catifa Carta showcases \nexciting, aesthetically pleasing, high-\nperformance applications of scraped paper. The \nend-of-life also excites: the pyrolysis process will \nturn the material into biochar.\nCatifa Carta by Arper (Photo by Arper)\nCatifa Carta by Arper (Photo by Arper)\n18/22\n1/14\n3/21\nBiodesign Report 2024\n Materials with memory\nLamp \"Sun\" in the \"Dune\" collection by Luis Gimeno (Photo by Luis Gimeno)\nOne of the highest acclaimed exhibitions on \nbiofabrication would be ECAL’s (Ecole Cantonale \nd'Art de Lausanne) exhibition \"Under Pressure \nSolutions”. This project offers an interesting \napproach to addressing transportation issues in \nfurniture design. \n\nThe exhibition highlights works on cellulose \nsponge, a bio-sourced and biodegradable \nmaterial. The team was made of ECAL’s students \nand tutors, imagining a lightweight furniture system \nthat can be compressed for efficient shipping and \nlater expanded upon arrival with just a bit of \nmoisture.\n19/22\nECAL’s exhibition \"Under Pressure Solutions” at Milan Design Week 2024 (Photo by ECAL)\nThese colours we chose for the Fall/Winter \n24/25 reflect a broader trend towards \nbiomaterials and Biodesign. As we look \nforward to Paris Design Week in September \n2024, we anticipate even more innovative uses \nof these colours across different design \ndisciplines, while giving a nod to nature, the \noutside world, and the wonders they bring to \nour lives. \n17-5440 TCX \nOcean Floor\nVIRIDIAN\nCHARTREUSE \n14-0445 TCX \nBright Chartreuse\nMAHOGANY\n19-1724 TCX \nCabernet\nBUTTER \nYELLOW\n13-0515 TCX \nLemon Icing\nPEACH FUZZ \n3-1023 TCX \nPeach Fuzz \nBiodesign Report 2024\nCOLOR TRENDS FALL/WINTER  2024-2025 REPORT\nDownload Color Trend 24/25 \n20/22\n21/22\nBiodesign Report 2024\nSTAY AHEAD \nOF THE \nCURVE\nFOLLOW TOCCO ON  \nINSTAGRAM @tocco.earth\nBiodesign Report 2024\n22/22\nProudly edited by the Tocco Media team\n\nFor media inquiries or further information, please contact us at: \nmedia@tocco.earth\n"
