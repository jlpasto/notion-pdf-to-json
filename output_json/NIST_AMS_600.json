\nLaboratory (EL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  The study \nprovides aggregate manufacturing industry data and industry subsector data to develop a \nquantitative depiction of the U.S. manufacturing industry. \n \n \nNIST AMS 600-13 \nNovember 2023 \nv \nExecutive Summary \nThis report provides a statistical review of the U.S. manufacturing industry. There are \nthree aspects of U.S. manufacturing that are considered: (1) how the U.S. industry \ncompares to other countries, (2) the trends in the domestic industry, and (3) the industry \ntrends compared to those in other countries. The U.S. remains a major manufacturing \nnation; however, other countries are rising rapidly.  \n \nAlthough U.S. manufacturing performs well in many respects, there are opportunities for \nadvancing competitiveness. This will require strategic placement of resources to ensure \nthat U.S. investments have the highest return possible. \n \nCompetitiveness – Manufacturing Industry Size: In 2021, there was $14.5 trillion of \nvalue added (i.e., GDP) in global manufacturing in constant 2015 dollars. The U.S. \naccounted for $2.4 trillion (16.3 %) in manufacturing valued added while China \naccounted for $4.5 trillion (30.9 %). Direct and indirect (i.e., purchases from other \nindustries) manufacturing accounts for 24.1 % of GDP. Among the ten largest \nmanufacturing countries, the U.S. is the 4th largest manufacturing value added per capita \n(see Figure 2.5) and out of all countries the most recent U.S. rank is 14th, as illustrated in \nFigure 2.6. In 2020, China outranked the U.S. in all of 6 major subsectors (see Figure 2.8) \n \n \nCompetitiveness – Manufacturing Growth: Compound real (i.e., controlling for \ninflation) annual growth in the U.S. between 1996 and 2021 (i.e., 25-year growth) was \n2.1 %, which places the U.S. below the 50th percentile. The compound annual growth for \nthe U.S. between 2016 and 2021 (i.e., 5-year growth) was 2.2 %. This puts the U.S. just \nabove the 50th percentile, above Canada and Germany among others. \n \nCompetitiveness – Productivity: Labor productivity for manufacturing decreased by \n1.0 % between the second quarter of 2022 and the second quarter of 2023, as illustrated \nin Figure 4.9. The five-year compound annual growth is -0.6 %. For U.S. manufacturing, \ntotal factor productivity increased 3.6 % from 2020 to 2021 and has a 5-year compound \nannual growth rate of 0.7 %, as illustrated in Figure 4.10. Productivity in the U.S. is \nrelatively high compared to other countries. As illustrated in Figure 4.11, the U.S. is \nranked ninth in output per hour among 142 countries using data from the Conference \nBoard. In recent years, productivity growth has been negative or has come to a plateau in \nmany countries and the U.S. seems to be following this pattern of slow growth. There are \ncompeting explanations for why productivity has slowed, such as an aging population, \ninequality, or other factors. A number of the explanations equate to low levels of capital \ninvestment. It is also important to note that productivity is difficult to measure and even \nmore difficult to compare across countries. Moreover, the evidence does not seem to \nsupport any particular explanation over another as to why productivity appears to have \nstalled. \n \nCompetitiveness – Economic Environment: There is no agreed upon measure for \nresearch, innovation, and other factors for doing business, but there are a number of \nNIST AMS 600-13 \nNovember 2023 \nvi \ncommon measures that are used. The ranking of the U.S. in these measures has mixed \nresults, ranking high in some and lower in others. For instance, the U.S. ranks 4th in \npatent applications per million people but ranks 17th in researchers per capita and 24th in \njournal article publications per capita. The IMD World Competitiveness Index, which \nmeasures competitiveness for conducting business, ranked the U.S. 9th in competitiveness \nfor conducting business and the World Economic Forum, which assesses the \ncompetitiveness in determining productivity, ranked the U.S. 2nd.  Note that neither of \nthese are specific to manufacturing, though. A third index specific to manufacturing, the \nDeloitte Global Manufacturing Index, ranks China 1st and the U.S. 2nd. The Competitive \nIndustrial Performance Index, which measures capacity to produce and export \nmanufactured goods; technological deepening and upgrading; and world impact, ranked \nthe U.S. as 5th.  \n \nDomestic Specifics – Types of Goods Produced: The largest manufacturing subsector in \nthe U.S. is computer and electronic products followed by chemical manufacturing and \nfood, beverage, and tobacco products, as seen in Figure 2.12. Discrete technology \nproducts accounted for 37 % of U.S. manufacturing. \n \nDomestic Specifics – Economic Disruptions: From the pre-recession peak in the 4th \nquarter of 2007 to the 1st quarter of 2009 manufacturing declined 17 percentage points. \nManufacturing didn’t return to its pre-recession level until 2017. During the recent \npandemic, manufacturing value added declined 17 percentage points between the third \nquarter of 2019 and second quarter of 2020, but returned to similar levels within a year. \nAs of July 2023, employment was still 8.9 % below its 2005 level. As a result of the \npandemic, between January 2005 and January 2010, manufacturing employment declined \nby 19.6 %, as seen in Figure 4.1.  \n \nDomestic Specifics – Manufacturing Supply Chain Costs:  High-cost supply chain \nindustries/activities, which might pose as opportunities for advancing competitiveness, \ninclude various forms of energy production and/or transmission, various forms of \ntransportation, the management of companies and enterprises among other items listed in \nTable 3.6.  \n \nDomestic Specifics – Manufacturing Safety, Compensation, and Profits: As illustrated \nin Figure 4.5, employee compensation in manufacturing, which includes benefits, has had \na five-year compound annual growth of -1.0 %, but remains 6.3 % above total private \nindustry compensation. In May of 2018 the average hourly wages for the total private \nsector exceeded that of manufacturing, which was not the case before that time. \nCompensation in manufacturing, which includes benefits, still exceeds that of the total \nprivate industry; however, the difference has narrowed significantly. In terms of safety in \nmanufacturing, fatalities, injuries, and the injury rate have generally trended downward \nsince 2002, as seen in Figure 4.2. However, there has been a slight uptick. Between 2020 \nand 2021, fatal occupational injuries increased 12.6 % and nonfatal injuries/illnesses \nincreased 3.2 %.   \n \nNIST AMS 600-13 \nNovember 2023 \nvii \nFor those that invest in manufacturing, corporate profits have had a five-year compound \nannual growth of 10.4 %, as illustrated Figure 4.7, and nonfarm proprietors’ income for \nmanufacturing has had a five-year compound annual growth rate of -8.4 %, as illustrated \nin Figure 4.8.  \n \nNIST AMS 600-13 \nNovember 2023 \n1 \n \nIntroduction \n \nBackground  \nPublic entities have a significant role in the U.S. innovation process.1 The federal \ngovernment has had a substantial impact in developing, supporting, and nurturing \nnumerous innovations and industries, including the Internet, telecommunications, \naerospace, semiconductors, computers, pharmaceuticals, and nuclear power among \nothers, many of which may not have come to fruition without public support.2 Although \nthe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Small Business Innovation \nResearch Program (SBIR), and Advanced Technology Program (ATP) have received \nattention in the scholarly community, there is generally limited awareness of the \ngovernment’s role in U.S. innovation. The vastness and diversity of U.S. federal research \nand development programs along with their changing nature make them difficult to \ncategorize and evaluate,3 but their impact is often significant. For instance, the origins of \nGoogle are rooted in a public grant through the National Science Foundation.4, 5 One \nobjective of public innovation is to enhance economic security and improve our quality \nof life6, which is achieved in part by advancing efficiency in which resources are \nconsumed or impacted by production. This includes decreasing inputs, which amount to \ncosts, and negative externalities (e.g., environmental impacts) while increasing output, \n(i.e., the products produced), and the function of the product (e.g., the usefulness or \nquality of the product), as seen in Figure 1.1. In pursuit of this goal, the National Institute \nof Standards and Technology (NIST) has expended resources on a number of projects, \nsuch as support for the development of the International Standard for the Exchange of \nProduct Model Data (STEP),7 which reduces the need for duplicative efforts such as re-\nentering design data.  \n \n \n \n \n1 Block, Fred L and Matthew R.

There are five aspects that encapsulate the information \ndiscussed in this report: \n \n• Growth and Size: The size of the U.S. manufacturing industry and its growth rate \nas compared to other countries reveals the relative competitiveness of the \nindustry. \no Metrics: Value added, value added per capita, assets, and compound \nannual growth \n \n• Productivity: It is necessary to use resources efficiently to have a competitive \nmanufacturing industry. Productivity is a major driver of the growth and size of \nthe industry. \no Metrics: Labor productivity index, total factor productivity index, output \nper hour \n \n• Economic Environment: A number of factors, including research, policies, and \nsocietal trends, can affect the productivity and size of the industry.  \nNIST AMS 600-13 \nNovember 2023 \n3 \no Metrics: Research and development expenditures as a percent of GDP, \njournal articles per capita, researchers per capita, competitiveness indices, \ninflation, patents \n \n• Stakeholder Impact: Owners, employees, and other stakeholders invest their \nresources into manufacturing with the purpose of receiving some benefit. The \ncosts and return that they receive can drive industry productivity and growth. \nHowever, data is limited on this topic area. \no Metrics: Number of employees, compensation, safety incidents, profits, \nexports, hours worked \n \n• Areas for Advancement: It is important to identify areas of investment that have \nthe potential to have a high return, which can facilitate productivity and growth in \nmanufacturing. \no Metrics: High-cost supply chain components, country comparison indices \n \nCurrently, this annual report discusses items related to inputs for production and outputs \nfrom production. It does not discuss negative externalities, the inputs that are used in the \nfunction of a product (e.g., gasoline for an automobile), or the function of the product; \nhowever, these items might be included in future reports.  \n \nManufacturing metrics can be categorized by stakeholder, scale, and metric type (see  \nFigure 1.2). Stakeholders include the individuals that have an interest in manufacturing. \nAll the metrics in this report relate directly or indirectly to all or a selection of \nstakeholders. The benefits for some stakeholders are costs for other stakeholders. For  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.2: Data Categorization for Examining the Economics of Manufacturing \n \nStakeholders \nOwners \nEmployees \nConsumers \nCitizens \nScale \nIndirect Measure \nDirect Measure \nNominal \nNormalized \nContext: Compared \nover time and/or \nbetween \ncountries/industries \nNIST AMS 600-13 \nNovember 2023 \n4 \ninstance, the price of a product is a cost to the consumer but represents compensation and \nprofit for the producers. The scale indicates whether the metric is nominal (e.g., the total \nU.S. manufacturing revenue) or is adjusted to a notionally common scale (e.g., revenue \nper capita). The metric type distinguishes whether the metric measures manufacturing \nactivities directly (e.g., total employment) or measures those things that affect \nmanufacturing (e.g., research and development).  These metrics are then compared over \ntime and/or between industries to provide context to U.S. manufacturing activities. \n \nScope and Approach \nThere are numerous aspects one could examine in manufacturing. This report discusses a \nsubset of stakeholders and focuses on U.S. manufacturing. Among the many datasets \navailable, it utilizes those that are prominent and are consistent with economic standards. \nThese criteria are further discussed below. \n \nStakeholders: This report focuses on the employees and the owners/investors, as the data \navailable facilitates examining these entities. Future work may move toward examining \nother stakeholders in manufacturing, such as the consumers and general public. \n \nGeographic Scope: Many change agents are concerned with a certain group of people or \norganizations. Since NIST is concerned with \"U.S. innovation and competitiveness,\" this \nreport focuses on activities within national borders. In a world of globalization, this effort \nis challenging, as some of the parts and materials being used in U.S.-based manufacturing \nactivities are imported. The imported values are a relatively small percentage of total \nactivity, but they are important in regard to a firm’s production. NIST, however, \npromotes U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness; therefore, consideration of \nthese imported goods and services are outside of the scope of this report. \n \nStandard Data Categorization: Domestic data in the U.S. tends to be organized using \nNAICS codes, which are the standard used by federal statistical agencies classifying \nbusiness establishments in the United States. NAICS was jointly developed by the U.S. \nEconomic Classification Policy Committee, Statistics Canada, and Mexico’s Instituto \nNacional de Estadística y Geografía, and was adopted in 1997. NAICS has several major \ncategories each with subcategories. Historic data and some organizations continue to use \nthe predecessor of NAICS, which is the Standard Industrial Classification system (SIC). \nNAICS codes are categorized at varying levels of detail. The broadest level of detail is \nthe two-digit NAICS code, which has 20 categories. More detailed data is reported as the \nnumber of digits increase; thus, three-digit NAICS provide more detail than the two-digit \nand the four-digit provides more detail than the three-digit. The maximum is six digits. \nSometimes a two, three, four, or five-digit code is followed by zeros, which do not \nrepresent categories. They are null or place holders. For example, the code 336000 \nrepresents NAICS 336. International data tends to be in the International Standard \nIndustrial Classification (ISIC) version 3.1, a revised United Nations system for \nclassifying economic data. Manufacturing is broken into 23 major categories (ISIC 15 \nthrough 37), with additional subcategorization. This data categorization works similar to \nNAICS in that additional digits represent additional detail.  \nNIST AMS 600-13 \nNovember 2023 \n5 \n \nData Sources: Thomas (2012) explores a number of data sources for examining U.S. \nmanufacturing activity.8 This report selects from sources that are the most prominent and \nreveal the most information about the U.S. manufacturing industry. These data include \nthe United Nations Statistics Division’s National Accounts Main Aggregates Database \nand the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of Manufactures, among others. Because \nthe data sources are scattered across several resources, there are differences in what \nyearly data is available for a particular category or topic.  In each case, the most-up-to-\ndate and available information is provided for the relevant category. \n \nData Limitations: Like all collections of information, the data on manufacturing has \nlimitations. In general, there are 3 aspects to economic data of this type: 1) breadth of the \ndata, 2) depth of the data, and 3) the timeliness of the data. The breadth of the data refers \nto the span of items covered, such as the number of countries and years. The depth of the \ndata refers to the number of detailed breakouts, such as value added, expenditures, and \nindustries. In general, breadth and depth are such that when the number of items in each \nare multiplied together it equals the number of observations in the dataset for a particular \ntime period. For instance, if you have value added data on 5 industries for 20 countries \nfor a single year, then you would have 100 observations (i.e., 5 x 20 = 100). The \ntimeliness of the data refers to how recently the data was released. For instance, is the \ndata 1 year old or 5 years old at release. In general, data can perform well in 2 of these 3 \ncriteria, but it is less common to perform well on all 3 due to feasibility of data collection \n(see Figure 1.3). Moreover, in this report there is data that is very recent (timeliness) and \nspans numerous subsectors (depth), but it only represents the United States. On the other \nhand, there is data that spans multiple countries (breadth) and subsectors of \nmanufacturing (depth); however, this data is from several years ago. Fortunately, industry \nlevel trends change slowly; thus, the data may not be from the most recent years, but it is \nstill representative. \n \n \n \n8 Thomas, Douglas S. (2012).

It is defined as the \nincrease in the value of output at a given stage of production; that is, it is the value of \noutput minus the cost of inputs from other establishments.9 The primary elements that \nremain after subtracting inputs is taxes, compensation to employees, and gross operating \nsurplus; thus, the sum of these also equal value added. Gross operating surplus is used to \ncalculate profit, which is gross operating surplus less the depreciation of capital such as \nbuildings and machinery. The sum of all value added for a country is that nation’s Gross \nDomestic Product (GDP).  \n \nInternational Comparison  \nThere are a number of sources of international estimates of value added for \nmanufacturing. The United Nations Statistics Division National Accounts Main \nAggregates Database has a wide-ranging dataset that covers a large number of countries \nover a significant period of time. In 2021, there was $14.5 trillion of value added (i.e., \nGDP) in global manufacturing in constant 2015 dollars, which is 17.5 % of the value \nadded by all industries ($82.7 trillion), according to the United Nations Statistics \nDivision. Since 1970, manufacturing ranged between 13.7 % and 17.5 % of global GDP. \nThe top 10 manufacturing countries accounted for $10.4 trillion or 71.7 % of global \nmanufacturing value added: China (30.9 %), United States (16.3 %), Japan (6.1 %), \nGermany (4.9 %), South Korea (3.2 %), India (3.0 %), United Kingdom (2.2 %), Italy \n(1.9 %), France (1.7 %), and Indonesia (1.5 %).10 \n \nAs seen in Figure 2.1, U.S. compound real (i.e., controlling for inflation) annual growth \nbetween 1996 and 2021 was 2.1 %, which places the U.S. below the 50th percentile. This \ngrowth exceeded that of Germany, France, Canada, Japan, and Australia; however, it is \nslower than that for the world (3.8 %) and that of many emerging economies. It is \nimportant to note that emerging economies can employ idle or underutilized resources \nand adopt technologies that are already proven in other nations to achieve high growth \nrates. Developed countries are already utilizing resources and are employing advanced \ntechnologies; thus, comparing U.S. growth to the high growth rates in China or India has \nlimited meaning. As seen in Figure 2.2, the compound annual growth for the U.S. \nbetween 2016 and 2021 was 2.2 %. This puts the U.S. just above the 50th percentile \nabove Canada and Germany among others but still below the world growth of 2.9 %. \n \nAs seen in  Figure 2.3, among the 10 largest manufacturing nations, U.S. manufacturing \nvalue added, as measured in constant 2015 dollars, is the second largest.

As illustrated in Figure 2.4, U.S. manufacturing value added was \n11.5 % of national GDP in 2021. In comparison, Germany’s manufacturing industry was \n22.2 %, China was 28.4 %, and Japan was 20.6 % with the world average being 17.5 %. \nAlthough the U.S. is below average, this can be somewhat deceiving, as 2021 U.S. GDP \nper capita ($61 103) is significantly higher than both Japan ($34 603) and Germany \n($38 217) along with most other countries, which makes the denominator \ndisproportionally larger when calculating the proportion of the economy that \nmanufacturing represents. Thus, a more meaningful measure might be manufacturing \nGDP (i.e., value added) per capita. Among the ten largest manufacturing countries, the \nU.S. has the 4th largest manufacturing value added per capita, as seen in Figure 2.5. Out \nof all countries the U.S. ranks 14th, as seen in Figure 2.6. Since 1970, the U.S. ranking \nhas ranged between 11th and 16th. It is important to note that there are varying means for \nadjusting data that can change the rankings slightly. The UNSD data uses market \nexchange rates while others might use purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates. \nPPP is the rate that a currency in one country would have to be converted to purchase the \nsame goods and services in another country. The drawback of PPP is that it is difficult to \nmeasure and methodological questions have been raised about some surveys that collect  \nIndonesia\nFrance\nItaly\nUnited Kingdom\nIndia\nSouth Korea\nGermany\nJapan\nUnited States\nChina (mainland)\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\n3000\n3500\n4000\n4500\n1970\n1973\n1976\n1979\n1982\n1985\n1988\n1991\n1994\n1997\n2000\n2003\n2006\n2009\n2012\n2015\n2018\n$Billions 2015\nData Source: United Nations Statistics Division.

Since this data \ncovers multiple industries for multiple years (i.e., it has breadth and depth), it is a few \nyears old (i.e., 2015). Nonetheless, it likely provides a close representation, as national \nactivity generally moves slowly. \n \nA more recent estimate of manufacturing value added by subsector and country is \nprovided in Figure 2.8, which provides estimates for 2020; however, the subsectors are \nbroader than those in Figure 2.7. Data for some countries was not available, however, 76 \ncountries have data for all six subsectors. These countries represent 91.3 % of global \nmanufacturing. The data in Figure 2.8 shows the U.S. being the second largest country in \nterms of valued added for every subsector except textiles and clothing, where it is the \nfourth largest. China is the largest for all subsectors. \n \n \n \nFigure 2.6: Manufacturing Per Capita Ranking, 1970-2021: Lower is Better \nData Source: United Nations Statistics Division.

The first is using \nchained dollars, which uses a changing selection of goods to adjust for inflation. The \nsecond uses an unchanging selection of goods to adjust for inflation. 13 There has been \nsome dispute about the accuracy of each for some goods. This report presents value \nadded in chained dollars. Previous reports included both; however, the differences are \noften minor.  \n \n13 Dornbusch, Rudiger, Stanley Fischer, and Richard Startz.

From the pre-recession peak in the \n4th quarter of 2007 to the 1st quarter of 2009 manufacturing declined 17 percentage \npoints. Manufacturing didn’t return to its pre-recession level until 2017. During the recent \npandemic, manufacturing value added declined 17 percentage points between the third \nquarter of 2019 and second quarter of 2020, but returned to similar levels within a year.  \n \nManufacturing value added in the U.S. in 2022 was $2.3 trillion in chained 2012 dollars \nor 11.4 % of GDP.14 Using chained dollars from the BEA shows that manufacturing \nincreased by 0.2 % between 2021 and 2022. Figure 2.10 and Figure 2.11 provide more \ndetailed data on durable and nondurable goods within the manufacturing industry. As \nseen in Figure 2.10, long term growth in durable goods is largely driven by computer and \nelectronic products, which should be viewed with some caution, as there has been some \ndispute regarding the price adjustments for this sector, which affects the measured \ngrowth. Recall that, as of 2015, the U.S. was also the largest producer of computer and \nelectronic products. As seen in Figure 2.11, in 2022 only two of eight non-durable sectors \nwere above their 2008 value. The largest manufacturing subsector in the U.S. is computer \nand electronic products followed by chemical manufacturing; food, beverage, and \ntobacco products; and motor vehicles, trailers, and parts, as seen in Figure 2.12. Note that \nthis is based on chained dollars. Adjustments using other methods or the nominal value \ncan have slightly different results.  \n \n \nFigure 2.9: Cumulative Percent Change in Value Added (2012 Chained Dollars) \nBureau of Economic Analysis.

These items all feed \ninto the design and production of manufactured goods which are inventoried and/or \nshipped (gray). The depreciation of capital and net income is also included in Figure 3.1, \nwhich affects the market value of shipments. In addition to the stakeholders, there are \nalso public vested interests, the end users, and financial service providers to be \nconsidered. \n \nDirect and Indirect Manufacturing: As previously mentioned, to achieve economy-wide \nefficiency improvements, researchers have suggested that “the supply chain must become \nthe focus of policy management, in contrast to the traditional emphasis on single \ntechnologies/industries.” 16 As seen in Table 3.2, there is an estimated $1939 billion in \nmanufacturing value added with an additional $2339 billion in indirect value added from \nother industries for manufacturing, as calculated using input-output analysis.17 Direct and \nindirect manufacturing accounts for 24.1 % of total GDP.  \n \nIn 2021, the U.S. imported approximately 20.4 % of its intermediate goods, as seen in  \nTable 3.3. As a proportion of output and imports (i.e., a proportion of the total inputs), \nintermediate imports represented 12.4 %. As can be seen in Table 3.3, these proportions \nhave not changed dramatically in recent years. As seen in Table 3.4, Canada is the \nprimary source of imported supply chain items for the U.S. with China being second. \n \nMany of the direct costs are caused by losses due to waste or defects. Unfortunately, \nthere is limited data and information on these losses. The research that does exist is often \ncase studies within various industries and countries, which provide only limited insight to  \n \nTable 3.2: Direct and Indirect Manufacturing Value Added  \n  \n  \nValue Added ($ Billion 2019) \nNAICS \nDescription \nDirect \nIndirect \nTotal \n  \nTOTAL U.S. GDP \n  \n  \n17 775 \n31-33 \nTotal Manufacturing* \n1 939 \n2 339 \n4 278 \n333-336 \nDiscrete Technology Products \n676 \n680 \n1 356 \n313-323, 327-332, 337-339 \nDiscrete Products \n489 \n581 \n1 070 \n324-326 \nProcess Products \n534 \n1 077 \n1 611 \n311-312 \nFood, Beverage, and Tabaco \n240 \n629 \n869 \n* The sum of the 3 digit NAICS does not equal total manufacturing due to overlap in supply chains. \nSource: Thomas, Douglas.

There would be reductions in the burden \nof transportation, material handling, machinery, inventory costs, and energy use along \nwith many other activities associated with handling and altering materials.  \n \nAnother source of losses can be found in cybercrime where criminals can disrupt \nproduction and/or steal intellectual property.

Joseph Juran proposed that the \nPareto principle could be applied to an organization’s operations.25 For instance, 80 % of \ndefects would be the result of 20 % of the causes. Identifying that small portion of the \ncause (i.e., the 20 %) can facilitate making large efficiency improvements in operations. \nManufacturing industry NAICS codes are categories of production activities. A larger \nindustry (i.e., one in the top 20 %) suggests that there is more of a particular type of \nactivity and/or the activities are more costly; thus, an increase in productivity in a larger \nindustry would either reduce a costly activity or reduce an activity that occurs at high \nfrequency. The result is a greater impact than might otherwise be achieved. Additionally, \nstatistical evidence suggests that a dollar of research and development in a large cost \nsupply chain entity has a higher return on investment than a small cost one.26 Table 3.6 \nprovides a list of the top 20 % of domestic supply chain industries for U.S. manufacturing \nby value added. Various forms of energy production and/or transmission appear in the top \n20 %. Various forms of transportation are also present along with the management of \ncompanies and enterprises.

The \nCurrent Population Survey estimates that there were 15.2 million manufacturing employees in \n2022 and the Current Employment Statistics estimates 12.8 million employees in 2022, the most \nrecent data available (see Table 4.2 and Table 4.3). According to data in Table 4.2, \nmanufacturing accounted for 9.6 % of total employment. Each of these estimates has its own \nmethod for how the data was acquired and its own definition of employment. The Current \nPopulation Survey considers an employed person to be any individual who did any work for pay \nor profit during the survey reference week or were absent from their job because they were ill, on \nvacation, or taking leave for some other reason. It also includes individuals who completed at \nleast 15 hours of unpaid work in a family-owned enterprise operated by someone in their \nhousehold. In contrast, the Current Employment Statistics specifically exclude proprietors, self-\nemployed, and unpaid family or volunteer workers. Therefore, the estimates from the Current \nEmployment Statistics are lower than the Current Population Survey estimates. Additionally, the \nCurrent Employment Statistics include temporary and intermittent employees.

As of July 2023, employment was still 8.9 % below its 2005 level. In times of \nfinancial difficulty, large purchases are often delayed or determined to be unnecessary. Thus, as \nwould be expected, during the late 2000’s recession durable goods declined more than \nnondurable goods. The other major decline in manufacturing employment was during the \npandemic. Between January 2019 and April of 2020, manufacturing employment declined 10 \npercentage points to be 19.9 % below its 2005 level. By September 2021, manufacturing \nemployment had risen to 12.8 % below its 2005 level. However, at that time there were a \nsubstantial number of job openings in manufacturing as seen in Figure 4.1.  \n \nNIST AMS 600-13 \nNovember 2023 \n4 \n \nThe employees that work in manufacturing offer their time and, in some cases, risk their personal \nsafety in return for compensation. In terms of safety, the number of fatal injuries increased \n12.6 % between 2020 and 2021 (see Table 4.4). Nonfatal injuries increased as did the injury rate \n(see Table 4.5). The incident rate for nonfatal injuries in manufacturing remains higher than that \nfor all private industry. As illustrated in Figure 4.2, fatalities, injuries, and the injury rate have a \nfive-year compound growth rate of -3.8 %, -3.1 %, and -1.7 % respectively. \n \n \n \nFigure 4.1: Cumulative Change in Percent in Manufacturing Employment (Seasonally Adjusted) and \nNumber of Job Openings (seasonally Adjusted), 2005-2023 \nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Unlike employment, however, the number of hours worked per week returned to \nits pre-recession levels or slightly higher. Average wages increased significantly during the late \n2000’s recession and 2020 decline of GDP, as can be seen in Figure 4.4. This is likely because \nlow wage earners are disproportionately impacted by employment reductions, which suggests \nthat high wage earners not only receive more pay, but also have more job security. Average \nhours also dropped during the pandemic \nand has largely returned to pre-recession levels. Like the late 2000’s recession, during the \npandemic wages increased while hours and employment decreased.  \n \nFigure 4.3: Average Weekly Hours for All Employees (Seasonally Adjusted) \nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics. (2023b) Current Employment Statistics. http://www.bls.gov/ces/home.htm \n \nThe compound annual growth rate in real dollars for private sector wages was 0.6 % between \nJuly 2018 and July 2023 and compensation was -0.1 % for manufacturing. As illustrated in \nFigure 4.5, employee compensation in manufacturing, which includes benefits, has had a five-\nyear compound annual growth of -1.0 %, but remains 6.3 % above total private industry \ncompensation. In May of 2018 the average hourly wages for the total private sector exceeded \nthat of manufacturing, which was not the case before that time. Hourly compensation in \nmanufacturing, which includes benefits, still exceeds that of the total private industry; however, \nthe difference has narrowed significantly. In the first quarter of 2007, hourly compensation in \nmanufacturing was 17.2 % higher than the private sector. By the first quarter of 2023, this \ndifference narrowed to 6.3 %. As illustrated in Figure 4.6, the prices received by producers for \nall manufacturing between July 2020 and July 2022 has increased 33.4 % while in the fifteen \nyears prior to that (i.e., June 2005 to June 2020) it only increased 27.1 % total. For those that \ninvest in manufacturing, corporate profits have had a five-year compound annual growth of \n10.4 %, as illustrated Figure 4.7, and nonfarm proprietors’ income for manufacturing has had a \nfive-year compound annual growth rate of -8.4 %, as illustrated in Figure 4.8.  \n \n32.0\n34.0\n36.0\n38.0\n40.0\n42.0\n44.0\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\nHours Per Week\nTotal Private\nManufacturing\nDurable Goods\nNondurable Goods\nNIST AMS 600-13 \nNovember 2023 \n7 \n \n \n \nFigure 4.4: Average Hourly Wages for Manufacturing and Private Industry (Seasonally Adjusted) \nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides an index of labor productivity and total factor \nproductivity. Labor productivity for manufacturing decreased by 1.0 % between  the second \nquarter of 2022 and the second quarter of  2023, as illustrated in Figure 4.9. The five-year \ncompound annual growth is -0.6 %. The Bureau of Labor Statistics total factor productivity \nmeasures “the efficiency at which combined inputs are used to produce output of goods and \nservices” (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2023g). For U.S. manufacturing, total factor productivity \nincreased 3.6 % from 2020 to 2021 and has a 5-year compound annual growth rate of 0.7 %, as \nillustrated in Figure 4.10.

Four measures are often discussed regarding \ninnovation: number of patent applications, research and development expenditures, number of \nresearchers, and number of published journal articles. As seen in Figure 5.1, the U.S. ranked 4th \nin 2020 in resident patent applications per million people, which puts it above the 95th percentile \namong 138 countries. Using patent applications as a metric can be problematic though, as not all \ninnovations are patented and some patents might not be considered innovation. The U.S. ranked \n5th in research and development expenditures as a percent of GDP in 2020, which puts it above \nthe 90th percentile (see Figure 5.2) among 84 nations. As seen in Figure 5.3, U.S. enterprise \nresearch and development expenditures in manufacturing increased 1.8 % between 2018 and \n2019 and has a 5-year compound annual growth rate of 2.9 % (not shown). In terms of \nresearchers per million people, the U.S. ranked 17th in 2019, putting it just above the 80th \npercentile (see Figure 5.4). In journal articles per million people it ranked 24th in 2020, and \nChina had more articles than the U.S. (see Figure 5.5).28 Exports are also frequently seen as a \nmeasure of competitiveness. The U.S. was the second largest exporter in 2022, as seen in Figure \n5.6. \n \n \n  \n Figure 5.1: Patent Applications (Residents) per Million People, Top Ten (1990-2020) \nWorld Bank. 2023.

The IMD World Competitiveness Index provides \ninsight into the U.S. innovation landscape. Figure 5.7 provides the U.S. ranking for 20 measures \nof competitiveness. This provides some indicators to identify opportunities for improvement in \nU.S. economic activity. In 2023, the U.S. ranked low in prices, public finance, societal \nframework, and international trade among other things. Overall, the U.S. ranked 9th in \ncompetitiveness for conducting business.29  \n \nThe 2016 Deloitte Global Manufacturing Competitiveness Index uses a survey of CEOs to rank \ncountries based on their perception. The U.S. was ranked 2nd out 40 nations with China being \nranked 1st. High-cost labor, high corporate tax rates, and increasing investments outside of the \nU.S. were identified as challenges to the U.S. industry. Manufacturers indicated that companies \nwere building high-tech factories in the U.S. due to rising labor costs in China, shipping costs, \nand low-cost shale gas.30 According to \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5.4: Researchers per Million People, Ranking \nWorld Bank. 2023.

There are 3 aspects of U.S. \nmanufacturing that are considered: (1) how the U.S. industry compares to other countries, (2) the \ntrends in the domestic industry, and (3) the industry trends compared to those in other countries. \nThe U.S. remains a major manufacturing nation; however, other countries are rising rapidly. \nManufacturing in the U.S. was significantly impacted by the 2000’s recession and the 2020 \neconomy.  \n \nThe U.S. accounts for 16.3 % of global manufacturing, according to the United Nations Statistics \nDivision National Accounts Main Aggregates Database, making it the second largest. Compound \nreal (i.e., controlling for inflation) annual growth in the U.S. between 1996 and 2021 was 2.1 %, \nwhich places the U.S. below the 50th percentile. The compound annual growth for the U.S. \nbetween 2016 and 2021 was 2.2 %. This puts the U.S. just above the 50th percentile but above \nCanada and Germany among others. In terms of subsectors of manufacturing, the U.S. ranks 1st \nin 7 industries out of 16 total while China was the largest for the other industries, as reported in \nOECD data. \n \nIn 2022, there was an estimated $2.3 trillion in manufacturing value added in chained 2012 \ndollars. Using 2012 input-output data adjusted to 2019 dollars, there is an estimated $4278 \nbillion, including direct and indirect value added, associated with U.S. manufacturing. In 2019, \nthe U.S. imported approximately 20.4 % of its intermediate goods, according to BEA data. \nDiscrete technology products account for 41 % of manufacturing value added, according to BEA \ndata.  \n \nFrom the pre-recession peak in the 4th quarter of 2007 to the 1st quarter of 2009 manufacturing \ndeclined 17 percentage points. Manufacturing didn’t return to its pre-recession level until 2017. \nDuring the recent pandemic, manufacturing value added declined 17 percentage points between \nthe third quarter of 2019 and second quarter of 2020, but returned to similar levels within a year. \nBetween January 2005 and January 2010, manufacturing employment declined by 19.6 %. As of \nJuly 2023, employment was still 8.9 % below its 2005 level. Between January 2019 and April of \n2020, manufacturing employment declined 10 percentage points to be 19.9 % below its 2005 \nlevel. By September 2021, manufacturing employment had risen to 12.8 % below its 2005 level. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNIST AMS 600-13 \nNovember 2023 \n22 \n \nReferences \nAllwood, J. M. & Cullen, J. M. (2012).

U.S. Semiconductor Manufacturing \nU.S. semiconductor manufacturing value added was $30.4 billion in 2020 and was 10.6 % larger \nin 2020 than it was in 2008, as illustrated in Figure A 1. The industry value added has had a 5-\nyear compound annual growth rate of 4.2 %. The U.S. has a significant presence in the \nsemiconductor manufacturing industry with an estimated 12 % of the global production capacity \n(see Table A 1). As shown in both Table A 1 and Figure A 1, while U.S. semiconductor \nemployment has been relatively flat, manufacturing value added has generally grown; however, \nglobal growth has been faster, as seen in Table A 1. The result is that the U.S. share of the \nindustry went from 37 % in 1990 to 12 % in 2020. \n \nAs seen in Table A 2, the U.S. has 43 % of the 10 nm to 22 nm process technology market. \nGenerally, the lower the number, the greater the performance and the more technologically \nadvanced the technology because it represents the space for features on a chip.34 The U.S. has \nlittle to no capacity for the most advanced technology, which is at the 10 nm or less process \ntechnology. U.S. owned firms, which own facilities around the world, have a commanding \nposition in terms of the design of semiconductors, as seen in Table A 3. Additionally, U.S. firms \nheld significant proportions of national markets, including 49.9 % of the Chinese market, and  \n \n \nFigure A 1: Semiconductor Shipments, Value Added, and Employment, 2008-2021 \nSource: U.S. Census Bureau.

Additive Manufacturing \nTable B.1 provides an approximation of the shipments and value added of the goods produced \nusing additive manufacturing in the United States. For this report, this is referred to as the \nadditive manufacturing industry. There are other associated activities such as the production of \nthe additive manufacturing machinery and materials. These are costs/inputs of the additive \nmanufacturing industry. The approximated shipments of goods produced using additive \nmanufacturing in the U.S. is $2.8 billion with value added being $1.4 billion. These represent a \nsmall proportion of the manufacturing industry; however, it should not be concluded that this \ntechnology is not important or impactful, as it is often an input in the production of other goods. \nFor instance, in 2022 utilities were only 1.4 % of GDP, but where would the economy be without \nelectricity. Nuts and bolts are a small proportion of the value of a car, but how would be \nassemble an automobile without them. Additive manufacturing facilitates rapid prototyping to \nproduce products in a shorter period of time, weight/material reduction, and lower cost \nproduction for small batches and customized products, including parts for products that are no \nlonger produced. Moreover, the size of the industry does not represent the economic impact of \nthe technology. \n \n \nTable B.1: Approximation of U.S. Shipments and Value Added of Goods Produced using Additive \nManufacturing \nCategory \nRelevant NAICS Codes \nShipments of US \nMade AM \nProducts \n($millions, \n2021)* \nTotal US \nShipments \n($millions, \n2021) \nAM Share \nof \nIndustry \nShipments \nTotal \nValue \nAdded \n($millions, \n2021)* \nAM Value \nAdded \n($millions, \n2021) \nMotor vehicles \nNAICS 3361, 3362, 3363 \n433.48 \n620 402 \n0.07% \n180 836 \n126 \nAerospace \nNAICS 336411, 336412,  \n498.80 \n152 113 \n0.33% \n75 339 \n247 \n  \n336413 \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nMedical/dental \nNAICS 3391 \n463.17 \n94 889 \n0.49% \n62 293 \n304 \nGovernment/military \nNAICS 336414, 336415, \n178.14 \n40 502 \n0.44% \n14 821 \n65 \n  \n336419, 336992 \n  \n  \n  \n  \nArchitectural \nNAICS 3323 \n133.61 \n113 646 \n0.12% \n58 817 \n69 \nConsumer products/electronics,  \nAll other within NAICS \n1 054.01 \n954 970 \n0.11% \n527 054 \n582 \nacademic, and other \n332 through 339 \n  \n  \n  \n  \nTOTAL \nNAICS 332 through 339 \n2761.2 \n1 976 521 \n0.14% \n919 160 \n1 394 \n* These values are calculated assuming that the percent of total additive manufacturing made products for each industry is the same for \nthe US as it is globally.
